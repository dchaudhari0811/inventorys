# Simple Inventory System - React/JavaScript

Welcome to the Simple Inventory System! This is a straightforward and user-friendly application built using React and JavaScript to help you manage your inventory items effortlessly. With the ability to add items and search for specific ones based on their description, you can keep track of your inventory in no time!

## Inventory Item Management

### Adding Items
To add an item to the inventory, simply provide its name, cost, and a brief description of whether it's considered a "good" item or not. Once added, the item will be instantly available in the inventory for future reference.

### Updating Items
As your inventory evolves, you might need to make changes to existing items. Our system enables you to easily update any item's details. You can modify its name, cost, or description as your inventory information changes.

### Managing Item Quality
For each item in the inventory, you can indicate whether it's considered "good" or not. This quality indicator helps you quickly assess the desirability of your items, making it easier to make informed decisions when managing your inventory.

## Efficient Item Search

### Quick Search
The Inventory Management System offers a powerful search feature that allows you to find specific items based on the description you provide. No need to scroll through pages of inventory! Simply type in a keyword or phrase, and the system will instantly present you with a list of items that match your search criteria.
